- Tokenization for Authorization: Ensures secure and authenticated access to sensitive operations.
- Scalable Design: Built using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for reliability and scalability.

 Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Java  
- Frameworks: Spring Boot, Spring Cloud (OpenFeign for API communication)  
- Authentication: Tokenization  
- Architecture: REST APIs  
- External Services: MTN Mobile Money API  

How It Works

1. User Initiates Transaction  
   The user triggers a payment request with necessary details.  
2. Token-Based Authorization
